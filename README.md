My portfolio

## Synopsis
Simple portfolio for me, to give some sort of picture to people what I can do. It was previously hosted on my school server, but then I learned how wonderful the GitHub is. :)

## Motivation
I was thinking portfolio is nice thing to add when applying to a job, and I did not have one. That had to change, and so this page was crated. While doing the page, I decided to learn how to use SASS. And oh boy it was fun! 

## Todo
The page is still work in progress.

* Need to add my github-profile to the page.
* I did not have a clear vision of the finished site when I began coding it, so it does not work properly on every resolution. I was thinking about rebuilding it when I have time.
* Ditch the Javascript and use only CSS transitions (now that I've learned how to use them)
